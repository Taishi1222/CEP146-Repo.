Hi Gian.

I was reviewing your portfolio and think it would be great to add a project showcase section. Here are some ideas:

## Suggested Addition
A "Featured Projects" section that could include:
- Brief description of each project
- Technologies used
- Links to live demos or repositories
- Screenshots or GIFs if applicable

## Benefits
- Makes your portfolio more visually appealing
- Helps potential employers see your work quickly
- Demonstrates your range of skills

## Example Format
```markdown
## Featured Projects
### Project Name
- **Description:** Brief overview
- **Technologies:** List of tools/languages used
- **Link:** [View Project](link-here)
